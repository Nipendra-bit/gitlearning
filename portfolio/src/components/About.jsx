                I’m Nipendra Kumar Raghav, a final-year Computer Science & Engineering student at Mangalayatan University with a CGPA of 9.30.
                I specialize in backend and full-stack development, with strong proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and modern frontend technologies like ReactJS and JavaScript.
                I’ve developed robust, secure, and scalable web applications including an Online Banking System and a real-time Chat Application using Spring Boot, REST APIs, WebSockets, and MySQL.
                My internship at NTPC gave me real-world experience in data migration, server optimization, and Java-MySQL integration.
                I’m passionate about building efficient and scalable solutions, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.
                I’m now seeking a full-time Java Developer role where I can contribute my skills and grow professionally.
